 <!-- Dot Product: The dot product of two vectors  -->
 <!-- 𝑣=(𝑣𝑥,𝑣𝑦) -->
 <!-- v=(vx ,vy​) and 𝑤=(𝑤𝑥,𝑤𝑦)in 2D space is calculated as: -->
 <!-- 𝑣⋅𝑤 = 𝑣𝑥 ⋅ 𝑤𝑥 + 𝑣𝑦 ⋅ 𝑤 -->

 <!-- Magnitude of a Vector: The magnitude (or length) of a vector  -->
 <!-- 𝑣=(𝑣𝑥,𝑣𝑦) in 2D space is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: -->
 <!-- ∥𝑣∥=sqrt(pow(𝑣𝑥,2)+pow(𝑣𝑦,2)​ -->

 <!-- Angle between Vectors: The cosine of the angle α -->
 <!-- α between two vectors can be calculated using the dot product and the magnitudes: -->
 <!-- cos(α)=𝑣⋅𝑤/∥𝑣∥.∥𝑤∥ -->

 <!-- Given the cosine of the angle, you can find the angle itself using the inverse cosine function (arccosine):-->
 <!-- α=arccos⁡(𝑣⋅𝑤/∥𝑣∥.∥𝑤∥) -->
